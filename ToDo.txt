- Score on training data is much higher than on validation data --> remove overfitting




# Done

- Rescale/Normalize Data (sklearn has a tool for that)
Georg:  Used sklearn StandardScaler. Should however not affect DecisionTrees.

- Use cross validation? Learning set might not be large enough.
Georg: Implemented RandomizedSearchCV, which is inherently using cross validation
