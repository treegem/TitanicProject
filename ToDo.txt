- Score on training data is much higher than on validation data --> remove overfitting

- Use cross validation? Learning set might not be large enough. (Georg started implementing RandomizedSearchCV)


# Done

- Rescale/Normalize Data (sklearn has a tool for that)
    Used sklearn StandardScaler. Should however not affect DecisionTrees.
