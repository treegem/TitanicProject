# THIS PROJECT

This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence that is capable of predicting the death/survival of any
titanic passenger.
The underlying data is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data


# GETTING STARTED

Before running any classifier for the first time, utility/create_config.py must be executed manually.
config.ini can then be updated manually or by updating create_config and running it again.

explore_train.py gives a first overview of the statistics of the data.

# TESTS

Tests are structured to be executed with pytest.
